# Gender-Classifier-by-Voice
This is a CNN classifier that i built as a first project after completing the first few lectures at fastai. I trained it using spectrogram 
images of voice clips (male and female) of American people. I did not use the entire dataset. Just about 1/4th of it and got an error of 1.0490% . Then, when I tested the result with spectrogram images of Nepalese female voice,
it shows surprisingly good results. A 100% accuracy on the 217 images I tested it on. If you are interested you can check the source code and give me some feeback.
